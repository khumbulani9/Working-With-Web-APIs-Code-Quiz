## User Story

As  a coding boot camp student
i want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

## Description of the assignment

As you proceed in your journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it’s likely that in order to be part of the team you maybe asked to complete a coding assessment, which maybe part of the initial interview assessment process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding Challenges.

In order to be well prepared for the occasion, help maybe required in order to become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework has taught you all the skills you need to succeed in this Challenge.
